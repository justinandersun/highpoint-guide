Spruce Knob is most famous for being the highest point in West Virginia. Less known are the other peakbagging categories for which Spruce Knob has noteworthy rankings. In example, Spruce Knob is not only the West Virginia State Highpoint, the peak is also the highest point of the Allegheny Mountains and Appalachian Plateaus. Spruce Knob is also the 13th-most isolated peak (with approximately 175 miles of isolation) in the contiguous United States, the 14th-most isolated U.S. State Highpoint, the 23rd-most prominent (with 2781' of clean prominence) U.S. State Prominence Point, the 24th-highest U.S. State Highpoint, the 25th-most prominent peak in the United States located east of the Mississippi River, and the 28th-highest County Highpoint located east of the Mississippi River.

Spruce Knob is located within both the Monongahela National Forest and Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks National Recreation Area (NRA), the latter of which was established during 1965 by the U.S. Congress. This is significant because the Spruce Knob-Seneca Rocks NRA was the first NRA to be designated as part of the USDA Forest Service. The NRA encompasses approximately 100,000 acres. Nearby Seneca Rocks is considered one of the best rock climbing areas in the region.

The summit can be attained by driving along decent forest roads and then a short easy walk. The summit has a public observation tower, constructed mostly of stone and steel, from which potentially far-ranging views of the surrounding landscape can be seen. A short trail leads to the summit, or a 0.5-mile loop trail (Whispering Spruce Trail) is also an option and offers more opportunities for scenery and views.

Despite being a peak with an elevation below 5000', and unlike many peaks in the southern half of the Appalachian Mountains, Spruce Knob has an alpine look and appeal. The mountain is quite windy at times, causing many of the trees near the summit to be misshapen like Krummholz. The terrain is predominantly spruce forest and meadows, but many of the slopes are noticeably comprised of large talus/boulder slabs. This rock type is mostly Pennsylvanian Pottsville Sandstone, a type of bedrock only found in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and western Maryland.

## Getting There
From the East (starting at I-81 near Harrisonburg, Virginia)
