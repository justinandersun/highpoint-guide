## Overview
The mountain was originally named Tahoma or "Great Snowy Peak" by the Yakima Indians. Captain George Vancouver renamed it after Admiral Peter Rainier of the British Navy during a scouting expedition on May 7, 1792. This name was hotly contested for over 100 years, because Americans felt it shouldn't be named after a British officer who had never even been to the U.S.

## Red Tape
Climbers must register to travel above 10,000 feet or onto glaciers. Primary registration locations are the Paradise Ranger Station, White River Wilderness Information Center, and the Wilkeson Wilderness Information Center. The climbing fee is $45 per person per calendar year. The fee is payable when registering. Climbing fees help recover costs for protecting the mountain's delicate and unique alpine environment, staffing the mountain's high camps and ranger stations with climbing rangers, managing upper mountain human waste and providing rangers who can rapidly respond to incidents on the mountain.

## Getting There
Mount Rainier National Park has great road access from all directions in the summer, however many of the roads are closed in the winter.  There is an entrance fee of $15.00 for a vehicle.  The pass is good for 7 days.  A Mount Rainier pass is available for purchase and is good for one year.  The price of the pass is $20.00.  Do the math ... if you are going to make more than 2 trips into the park in a given year, consider buying the year long pass.
