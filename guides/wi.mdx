At 1,951 feet above sea level, Timms Hill is the high point for the state of Wisconsin, which ranks as the 39th state in order of elevation.

Timms Hill is located in the north central part of the state, near the small town of Ogema, WI. It is only 1 of 2 state highpoints that is located within a county park. (The other is Britton Hill in Lakewood Park in Walton County, FL.)

There are 2 lookout towers guarding the summit. The newer wooden tower is about 15 meters high and easily climbed via stairs for great views looking to the north, south and east. The older steel radio tower is climbed via an exposed attached ladder and rises 22 meters to offer a spectacular 360 degree view above the surrounding tree canopy. For those daring enough, the view is well worth the effort. There is a vertical cable with stops every 20ft that you can tie onto if you bring a climbing harness to add a level of protection while climbing the ladder. The geological survey marker is located under the steel tower.

## Getting There
From Tomahawk, WI drive 22.2 miles west on State Highway 86 to County Road RR. Turn left (south) onto CR-RR and watch for signs to Timms Hill County Park on the right hand side. Follow the dirt road a few miles until you reach the parking lot for the Timms Hill trail.

From Ogema, WI, take SH86 east to County Road C. Follow CR-C south until you reach County Road RR. There's a posted sign at the junction of the 2 roads that reads, "Road to Timm's Hill County Park 1 mile". Turn left onto CR-RR. Turn left onto the paved road at the signed entrance to the park and follow it until you reach the parking lot for the Timms Hill trail.

## Recommended Route
The Timms Hill Trail to the highpoint gains a mere 140ft over the 1/4 mile distance and is well marked at the parking lot.

## Red Tape
The park gate is normally open from 7:30am until dusk from May through October. There are no pre-set hours in the fall or winter, but you can hike or cross country ski into the park anytime. Admittance is free. There are no permits required. Pets must be under control or remain on a leash at all times.

## Camping
There is no camping allowed in Timms Hill County Park. However there are plenty of places to camp nearby, and several options for hotels in the area.

There are also cabins for rent in the Highpoint Village which is located at the south end of Bass Lake.

## Fun Facts
- The word "Wisconsin" originates from the Chippewa word "Ouisconsin," believed to mean "grassy place."
- Timms Hill is named after Timothy Gahan who owned a logging camp on Timms Lake before Price County purchased the land and turned it into a park in 1983.
