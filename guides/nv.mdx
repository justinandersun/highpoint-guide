The summit of Boundary Peak is the highest point in the State of Nevada.  Residing at the Northern end of the White Mountains, it is part of a twin peak with Montgomery Peak in California, which is 298' higher and separated by 2/3rds of a mile via a very rocky ridge.  Boundary Peak itself only has a prominence of a little over 250'.

Boundary Peak derives its name from the proximity to the boundary between the two states that runs down the saddle between the two peaks and was likely named by surveyors who were working in the West in the mid 1800s. The actual boundary between the two states was finally legally settled in 1980. The controversy stemmed from a survey done in 1873 by Alexey VonSchmidt. His survey placed placed the border from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River askew with that established by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey between 1893 and 1899, putting Boundary Peak in California. If the USGS had not changed the border, Wheeler Peak in Great Basin National Park, would be Nevada's high point. Many still consider Wheeler Peak a more spectacular peak and would have been a more worthy destination for the highest point in the Silver State.

Most people who climb this peak are doing so in their quest to gain the high point in as many states as possible. There are two routes that meet up at a saddle 2,300' below the summit.  Trails lead to the saddle, while the remaining stretch is a strenuous walk up through a tremendous amount of scree with some minor scrambling near the summit.

## Getting There

No matter what direction one is coming from, you must get to Nevada Highway 264. About 200 yards south of the junction of Nevada Highway 264 and Nevada Highway 773 is a rough dirt road heading west. A 4-wheel drive is not required, but a high clearance vehicle is recommended, especially for the last mile or so. There are also a couple of small streams/washes to be crossed. Follow this road for approximately 14.7 miles to the trail head. At 2 miles continue straight at a cross road and again at 2.4 miles. At about 11 miles you will come upon the B & B Mine, here you will turn right and the quickly left. Going straight instead of the right will take you to a parking area, two rights take you to the mines buildings. At mile 12.1 there is another road junction but plainly signed. Proceed up the canyon which is a right hand turn. At about 13 miles you will pass a small reservoir and possibly some fishermen. Here the road narrows and gets quite rough.

Some people do use the Queen Canyon Road off U.S. Highway 6 just east of the California - Nevada border. It is a very rough road but passable to the Queen Mine at 9200 fee

## Recommended Route
Follow the Boundary Peak trail 7.4 miles out and back to the summit.

## Red Tape
There are no wilderness permits required for passage into or camping in the Boundary Peak Wilderness. There is a sign-in / sign-out log in a wood box on a post at the trailhead. If you plan on camping, a campfire permit is required.

## Camping
Some people camp at the small reservoir along the road. Some have camped at the trail head. One can also camp up in Trail Canyon, but there are very few level places to place a tent.. Be sure to bring plenty of water as this is a desert. The only water is a small stream with a spring up Trail Canyon but there are also alot of cows grazing, drinking the water and doing their thing in it, so be sure to treat any water from this spring / stream.
