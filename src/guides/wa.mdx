Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano rising to 14,410 feet, is the tallest peak in the Cascade Range and the most glaciated mountain in the contiguous United States. It offers challenging climbs, stunning views, and various routes catering to climbers of different skill levels. The mountain's unique landscape, from lush forests to icy glaciers, draws over 10,000 climbers yearly.

Mount Rainier, originally named **Tahoma** or "Great Snowy Peak" by the Yakima people, has a rich cultural and historical significance. It was renamed by Captain George Vancouver in 1792 after Admiral Peter Rainier of the British Navy, a name that sparked controversy among Americans who preferred a name reflecting local heritage. The mountain's first documented ascent occurred on August 17, 1870, by General Hazard Stevens and Philemon Van Trump, guided by Yakima Indian Sluiskin, who helped them reach its base. Upon reaching the summit, the party faced extreme exhaustion and took shelter in a steam vent to recover.

In 1899, President William McKinley established Mount Rainier National Park, protecting 235,625 acres, including 25 significant glaciers, such as the vast Emmons Glacier. As the highest volcano in the continental USA, Mount Rainier is a popular training ground for mountaineers aiming for higher peaks worldwide.

The Disappointment Cleaver (DC) route is the most popular ascent path for reaching the summit of Mount Rainier. This route, accessible from the Paradise area, is well-traveled and offers a clear path to the summit. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the milestones along the way:
1. **Paradise (5,500 ft):** The journey begins at the Paradise parking lot, a popular trailhead that can get crowded. The initial part of the hike follows a well-marked path across the Paradise meadows.
2. **Muir Snowfield (to 10,000 ft):** Climbers ascend this extensive snowfield to reach Camp Muir. The route can be straightforward in clear weather but requires careful navigation in poor conditions. Be mindful of potential crevasses, especially as the season progresses.
3. **Camp Muir (10,080 ft):** This is a central resting point with a public shelter, ranger station, and basic facilities. Camp Muir serves as the primary staging area for summit attempts. Climbers often spend the night here to acclimate to the altitude.
4. **Cowlitz Glacier and Cathedral Gap:** After leaving Camp Muir, the route crosses the Cowlitz Glacier. Climbers ascend through the Cathedral Gap, a rocky section requiring careful footing. Roping up is advisable due to potential crevasse danger.
5. **Ingraham Flats (11,000 ft):** A potential alternative camping spot, Ingraham Flats offers stunning views and a more direct path to the summit. The area can be dangerous due to exposure to icefall from above.
6. **Disappointment Cleaver:** The DC is a prominent rocky ridge that climbers ascend using fixed ropes. This section involves scrambling over loose rocks and can be challenging, especially later in the season when the snow has melted.
7. **Upper Glacier Ascent:** After ascending the Cleaver, climbers traverse the upper glacier towards the summit crater. This final stretch is steep and requires caution due to crevasses and the thinning air.
8. **Summit Crater and Columbia Crest (14,411 ft):** The route reaches the crater rim at around 14,150 ft. From here, climbers often continue to Columbia Crest, the true summit of Mount Rainier, for panoramic views and the summit log.

## Regulations
Climbers must secure a **Climbing Permit** and pay an **Annual Climbing Fee** ($68 per person in 2024) for access above 10,000 feet or on glaciers. Permit pickups must occur in person at ranger stations, and climbers should make a reservation during peak months. Solo climbers require a special permit, and all climbers must be at least 18 years old unless accompanied by a guardian.

## Lodging & Camping
Camping options near Mount Rainier include:
- **Cougar Rock Campground:** Located between Longmire and Paradise, offering RV spots, potable water, and flush toilets.
- **White River Campground:** Close to the White River entrance, providing a more rustic experience with vault toilets.
- **Mowich Lake Campground:** A primitive site with no potable water, accessible via an unpaved road.

Spend extra days at higher elevations, such as Camp Muir, to help your body adjust to the altitude. Gradual acclimatization can reduce the risk of altitude sickness and improve your chances of reaching the summit.

### How should I prepare physically for the climb?
Training should focus on endurance, strength, and altitude acclimatization. Climbers should perform regular cardio exercises, weight training, and hiking with a heavy pack.

### Are there any technical skills required for the Disappointment Cleaver route?
Basic mountaineering skills are essential, including crampon and ice axe use, glacier travel techniques, and rope team travel. It's also beneficial to be familiar with crevasse rescue techniques.
