Arkansas boasts the unique Ozark Mountains formed by tectonic activity. Among the oldest in North America, the state's three main mountain ranges run east-west rather than north-south, contributing to Mount Magazine's mesa-like appearance. Mount Magazine is a flat-topped plateau with a sandstone cap rimmed by steep rock cliffs, featuring two peaks: Signal Hill and Mossback Ridge. Signal Hill is the highest peak in Arkansas and the Ozark plateau. The highpoint resides in the Boston Mountains of the Northern Ouachitas, 120 miles northwest of Little Rock.

In the 1870s, Benjamin Benefield homesteaded 160 acres on Mount Magazine's southeastern leg. Once occupied by orchards, vineyards, and row crops, WPA/CCC crews built campgrounds and picnic facilities in 1939, rediscovered after being abandoned during World War II. Today, the trail makes a loop through a mixed pine and hardwood forest, crossing Highway 309 and leading to a wildlife pond. The eastern end of the Mossback Ridge Trail starts near the pond. The Benefield Trail loops back to the highway at the picnic area entrance, offering opportunities to enjoy wildflowers, butterflies, birds, and possibly deer and bear sightings.
