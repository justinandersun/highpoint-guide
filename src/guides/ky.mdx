Black Mountain, the highest point in Kentucky at 4,145 feet, is situated within a couple of hours from notable landmarks like Mt. Rogers, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and Mount Mitchell. Although Kentucky is primarily known for its extensive cave systems rather than its mountains, Black Mountain stands out with its significant elevation.

Historically, the mountain has been underappreciated, with coal mining activities reaching its upper slopes and a high-voltage tower installed just a short distance from the summit. Previously, hikers needed a waiver to access the summit due to the presence of coal company employees, but this requirement dropped following the state's acquisition of the high point in 2018. Improvements to enhance the visitor experience are underway, with plans for a new lookout tower to provide better views from the summit.

Black Mountain rests on the border between Kentucky and Virginia. The closest interstate is I-81, and the mountain is approachable from various roads between Bristol, Tennessee, and Marion, Virginia. The key route to get to Black Mountain is Route 160, near Lynch, Kentucky. Route 160 is a scenic, winding mountain road, and the turn-off to the summit lies between the "Welcome to Virginia" and "Welcome to Kentucky" signs. The road is on the left from Virginia, and visitors can park at the base. The road to the summit is unmarked but easy to find, especially since it leads upward, and there is a tower at the summit.

## Recommended Route
Visitors can drive near the summit via the mountain road for most of the year.

However, in winter, the road can become icy, making it safer to walk the 1.5 miles and ascend 250 feet to the summit. For this longer hike, follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/kentucky/black-mountain-kentucky-highpoint">Black Mountain Trail</a>.
