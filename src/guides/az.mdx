Humphreys Peak is the highest mountain in Arizona, located in Coconino County in the northern part of the state. Standing over 12,000 feet tall, it is the 26th most prominent peak in the contiguous United States, rising more than 6,000 feet above the surrounding terrain. Humphreys Peak is part of the San Francisco Mountain range and lies within the Kachina Peaks Wilderness Area, which encompasses 18,960 acres.

Though hiking guides often describe the summit hike as strenuous, it is relatively easy to moderate compared to other western high points. The peak offers a unique experience, often described as "Arizona's little Colorado," with its alpine environment seeming out of place in the desert. The views from the top are spectacular, offering sights of the Grand Canyon's North Rim to the north, the White Mountains and Holbrook to the east, and the desert mountains near Phoenix to the south. Named after General A. A. Humphreys, a U.S. Chief of Engineers, the peak is a hidden gem that defies the common misconception of Arizona as a flat, treeless desert.

## Access Point

To reach the Humphreys Peak trailhead from Flagstaff, take US 180 toward the Grand Canyon. After about 7 miles, turn right onto Snowbowl Road and continue for another 7 miles. The trailhead sits at a dirt parking lot below the skiing area of the Arizona Snowbowl. Starting from the Snowball is the standard and most popular approach, often busy on weekends with over 100 hikers on the trail.

## Recommended Route
Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/arizona/humphreys-peak">Humphreys Trail</a>.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/arizona/humphreys-peak?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

Humphreys Trail begins at the Arizona Snowbowl and is well-marked until reaching the saddle. The first 3 miles of the trail involve a gradual climb, while the last 1¾ miles become steeper and more challenging. The trail can be difficult to follow near the top, but posts have been placed along the last 0.75 mile to help guide hikers. The trail is rocky and loose above 12,000 feet, ascending three false summits before reaching the true summit. The hike is considered moderate to difficult, but most people in reasonable shape can complete it, provided they do not suffer from altitude sickness. The total round-trip distance is approximately 9.5 miles.
Be cautious not to take the other trail that starts at the same location as the Humphreys Trail but heads down the mountain, as it leads to a dead end in the woods. This trail is about ½ mile long and ends at a nice camping spot, but it is not the correct route to Humphreys Peak.

## Regulations
No permits are required to hike Humphreys Peak. However, climbing the neighboring Mount Agassiz is illegal and can result in a $500 fine. While enforcement is sporadic, it is best to adhere to the regulations.
