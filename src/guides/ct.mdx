The southwest shoulder of Mt. Frissell stands as Connecticut's highest point. It's unique among state highpoints because while it's the highest point in Connecticut, it's not the mountain's summit. The most accessible route starts from the AMC Parking area near the Massachusetts-Connecticut state line on Mt. Washington Road. This hike offers rewarding views, especially from Round Mountain and the steeper sections of Mt. Frissell, including the state highpoint.

From the North: Starting in South Egremont, Massachusetts, follow SR 23 west to SR 41, turning left (south). Shortly after, take a right onto Mount Washington Road. Continue past Bash Bish Falls State Park. The road eventually turns to gravel/dirt. After passing a Massachusetts/Connecticut state line marker, you'll find a small parking area on the left with an AMC sign.

From the South: In Salisbury, Connecticut, head west on US 44, then turn right onto Factory Street. Bear right onto Mt. Riga Road, which becomes a gravel road. Continue for a few miles to Mt. Washington Road, turn right, and drive 3.3 miles to the AMC parking lot on the right.

## Recommended Route
Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/massachusetts/mt-frissel-ct-highpoint-short-trail">Mount Frissell Trail</a>.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/massachusetts/mt-frissel-ct-highpoint-short-trail?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

Start at the AMC parking lot and head north along the road, passing the state line marker. Turn left onto an old gravel road where a well-marked trail with red blazes veers left from this road. The trail climbs steeply up Round Mountain, offering panoramic views. You'll then descend slightly before ascending Mt. Frissell. At the summit, the trail splits: the right spur leads to Mt. Frissell's true summit, marked by a canister on a tree, while the left spur descends southwest to the highpoint. Look for a cairn with a state line marker indicating Connecticut's highest point.

## Restrictions
Parts of Mt. Washington Road may close in winter due to snow.

## Lodging & Camping
Bash Bish Falls State Park, nearby, offers camping facilities. The park is known for its picturesque waterfall, where the water splits over a rock and reunites in a striking diamond.
