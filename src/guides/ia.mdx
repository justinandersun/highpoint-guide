Hawkeye Point is the pride and highpoint of Iowa. While the eastern part of the state, near the Mississippi River, boasts some hills and rocks, western Iowa is known for its flatness. However, Hawkeye Point stands out, rising 20 feet above the surrounding farmland and offering excellent panoramic views of the Iowa landscape. This farmland summit is a cherished landmark, with local landowners and the county working together to maintain accessibility and appeal. Visitors are welcomed with open arms but should respect the land, visit during reasonable hours, and leave no trace.

Osceola County now owns the highpoint, thanks to the generosity of the Sterler family, who donated 1.6 acres around the highpoint to ensure its continued accessibility. Osceola County purchased an additional five acres around the highpoint in 2007.
