From its newly constructed observation tower, Sassafras Mountain offers a stunning panoramic view of three statesâ€”South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. Located within the Jocassee Gorges Wilderness Area, it is a popular destination for hikers, nature lovers, and those seeking breathtaking vistas.

Sassafras Mountain is named after the native sassafras trees that thrive in the area. These trees have historical significance, as Native Americans used them for medicinal purposes and as a cooking spice. Later, settlers used sassafras wood for various constructions. The name reflects the mountain's natural heritage and the tree's role in the local ecosystem. The observation tower, opened in 2019, further enhances the mountain's appeal, offering an elevated perspective of the surrounding landscapes.
