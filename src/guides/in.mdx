Nestled in a grove of trees beside a field in Eastern Indiana, Hoosier Hill stands as the state's highest point at 1,257 feet above sea level in the American Heartland. Despite its modest elevation, this peak has a unique charm and history. The area leading up to Hoosier Hill gradually ascends, but the highpoint is relatively flat, marked by a sign in the woods.

Originally fenced off, Hoosier Hill became accessible thanks to Boy Scout Kyle Cummings, who chose the site for his Eagle Scout project. Cummings and his troop landscaped the area with the landowner's permission, adding a gravel driveway, cairn, picnic table, logbook, mailbox, and a lockbox for donations from local retailers and neighbors. The hill remains on the private property of Kim Goble, who graciously allows visitors to access this geographic landmark.

Hoosier Hill also holds a special place in highpointing history as the final state highpoint visited by A.H. Marshall, the first person to ascend all 50 state highpoints. However, in recent years, a landfill in neighboring Randolph County has sought permission to stack its garbage above Hoosier Hill's elevation, sparking controversy. While it is unclear if the landfill has surpassed Indiana's natural peak, Hoosier Hill remains a well-cared-for and significant site, thanks to the efforts of the local community and dedicated individuals.
