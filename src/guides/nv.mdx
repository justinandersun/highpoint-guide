Boundary Peak, at 13,147 feet, is the highest point in Nevada and offers an exhilarating adventure for hikers. Situated at the northern end of the White Mountains, this peak is part of a twin summit with Montgomery Peak in California, which stands 298 feet higher. A rugged ridge separates the peaks by about two-thirds of a mile. Despite its modest prominence of just over 250 feet, Boundary Peak provides hikers with stunning vistas and a challenging climb.

Boundary Peak derives its name from its proximity to the Nevada-California state line, which runs through the saddle between Boundary and Montgomery Peaks, and the two states did not resolve the boundary dispute until they were legally settled in 1980. The controversy originated from a survey conducted in 1873 by Alexey Von Schmidt, whose inaccurate boundary line placed Boundary Peak in California. Later surveys corrected this error, placing Boundary Peak within Nevada. If surveyors had not adjusted the boundary, Wheeler Peak in Great Basin National Park would hold the title of Nevada's highest point.

To reach the primary access point for Boundary Peak, you need to get to Nevada Highway 264. Approximately 200 yards south of Nevada Highway 264 and Nevada Highway 773 junction is a rough dirt road heading west. While a 4-wheel drive vehicle is not required, a high-clearance vehicle is recommended, especially for the final mile. The road includes a few small streams and washes to cross. Follow this road for about 14.7 miles to the trailhead, noting several waypoints along the way:
- At 2 miles: Continue straight at a crossroads.
- At 2.4 miles: Continue straight again.
- At 11 miles: Turn right at the B & B Mine, then quickly left. (Turning left leads to a parking area; two rights lead to the mine buildings.)
- At 12.1 miles: Follow the signed road up the canyon to the right.
- At about 13 miles: Pass a small reservoir and continue on the rough road to the trailhead.

An alternative route is the Queen Canyon Road off U.S. Highway 6, just east of the Nevada-California border. This road is very rough but passable up to the Queen Mine at 9,200 feet.
