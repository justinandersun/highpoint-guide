Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, stands in the Monongahela National Forest and offers breathtaking panoramic views of the Allegheny Mountains. The area is known for its rugged beauty, diverse ecosystems, and the Spruce Knob Observation Tower, making it a must-visit for nature enthusiasts and hikers alike.

Spruce Knob is part of Spruce Mountain, the highest ridge in the Allegheny Mountains. The mountain and its surroundings are rich in natural history and cultural significance. Indigenous peoples such as the Shawnee, Cherokee, and Mingo tribes, who valued the area for its abundant resources, once resided near Spruce Knob. The observation tower was constructed in 1969 to give visitors a 360-degree view of the stunning landscape. Today, the U.S. Forest Service manages the area, making it a popular outdoor destination.

Despite its elevation of under 5,000 feet, Spruce Knob boasts an alpine appearance distinct from many other peaks in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The summit is often windy, resulting in the characteristic Krummholz effect, where trees are bent and twisted. The landscape mainly comprises spruce forests and meadows, with many slopes covered in large talus and boulder fields. These rocks are primarily Pennsylvanian Pottsville Sandstone, a unique bedrock found only in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and western Maryland.

### Is Spruce Knob getting renamed to "Trump Mountain"?
No. According to [The Inter Mountain](https://www.theintermountain.com/news/local-news/2025/02/officials-weigh-in-on-trump-mountain-bill/), a West Virginia house delegate introduced a resolution in February 2025 to rename Spruce Knob to "Trump Mountain" following President Donald J. Trump's death as a â€œlasting tribute to his legacy and enduring influence" to the people of West Virginia. If adopted, the resolution would go to the U.S. Board on Geographic Names for consideration. However, the bill has received strong opposition from other delegates and the public, so it is unlikely to move forward.
