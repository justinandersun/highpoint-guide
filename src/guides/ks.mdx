Mount Sunflower, standing at 4,039 feet above sea level, is the highest point in Kansas. Despite its name, Kansas is not mountainous, and Mount Sunflower is more of a gentle rise than a dramatic peak. Located in extreme western Kansas near the Colorado border in Wallace County, this high point offers a pleasant view and an intriguing visit. The summit area features an outsider art shrine created by Ed and Cindy Harold, the ranchers who own the land. They have adorned the site with a tall sunflower sculpture made from railroad spikes and a whimsical plaque that reads, "Nothing happened here in 1897."
