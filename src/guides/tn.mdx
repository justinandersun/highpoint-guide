At 6,643 feet, Kuwohi is the highest point in Tennessee and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Offering stunning 360-degree views, this iconic peak straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. Its accessibility and breathtaking scenery make it a must-visit for both casual hikers and highpointers.

Formerly known as Clingmans Dome, Kuwohi is a name with deep cultural significance to the Cherokee people.

Its unique design provides an unparalleled vantage point to appreciate the vastness of the Smoky Mountains.
