At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome is the highest point in Tennessee and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. With stunning 360-degree views, the iconic peak straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. It is a must-visit for both casual hikers and highpointers due to its accessibility and breathtaking scenery.

Clingmans Dome is named after Thomas Lanier Clingman, a U.S. Senator and Confederate general who explored the area in the mid-19th century. The observation tower at the summit, often called the "flying saucer," was constructed in 1959 and has since become a park symbol. The tower's unique design provides an unparalleled vantage point to appreciate the vastness of the Smoky Mountains.
