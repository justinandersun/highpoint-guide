Timms Hill stands as the highest point in Wisconsin at 1,951.5 feet. Nestled in the serene Timms Hill County Park, this destination offers the satisfaction of reaching the state's pinnacle and hiking, fishing, and more. Perfect for a day trip or a weekend adventure, Timms Hill provides panoramic views of the surrounding Northwoods, which are particularly stunning during the fall foliage.

Timms Hill is named after Timothy Gahan, a logger who camped near the hill in the late 1800s. Price County later purchased the land and converted it into a park in 1983. The park encompasses 220 acres, including Bass Lake and Timms Lake, offering numerous recreational opportunities. The observation tower at the summit is the main feature, providing 360-degree views of the forested landscape, making it a popular spot for locals and visitors.
