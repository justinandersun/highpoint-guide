Eagle Mountain is the highest natural point in Minnesota, standing at 2,301 feet above sea level. Located in the rugged and scenic Huron Mountain Range in the north-central Upper Peninsula, this peak offers a modest yet rewarding hike with surprising prominence and isolation. The 3.5-mile trail to the summit runs through the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), offering a backcountry experience with spectacular views and a variety of wildlife.

Eagle Mountain was recognized as Minnesota's highest point due to its prominent elevation and isolation, with 1,321 feet of clean prominence and 437 miles of isolation from the nearest higher ground in central North Dakota. The mountain is the highest point in the Superior National Forest and the BWCAW. Despite being the state's highest point, it is only 15 miles from Minnesota's lowest point at Lake Superior, which sits 600 feet above sea level. The area around Eagle Mountain is rich in natural beauty and has a history of logging operations, shaping the landscape.

From the Eagle Mountain Trailhead:
- The first two miles of the trail have little elevation gain and begin in thick forest. The area becomes full of lowland bogs with wooden plank walkways for major bog crossings. The trail is rocky and rugged.
- After two miles, the trail passes along the southern and western shore of Whale Lake. A minor forested hilltop north of the lake is often mistaken for Eagle Mountain but is a hill east of it.
- Near the northwest corner of Whale Lake, just after passing a campsite sign, turn left at the trail junction to remain on Eagle Mountain Trail.
- From Whale Lake, the trail briefly steepens for the first few hundred feet of gain. You'll witness two fantastic viewpoints en route to the summit.
- The summit is marked by a large commemorative plaque on a rock presumed to be over a billion years old. There is also a wide vista looking out to northern Minnesota's expansive forests and lakes.
