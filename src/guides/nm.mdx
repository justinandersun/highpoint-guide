Nestled in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Wheeler Peak stands tall as the highest point in New Mexico, reaching an elevation of 13,161 feet. The Sangre de Cristo range is a spectacular collection of peaks that stretches 250 miles from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Salida, Colorado. This majestic peak offers hikers a challenging yet rewarding adventure with panoramic views, diverse wildlife, and rich cultural history. Whether you're an experienced mountaineer or a dedicated hiker, Wheeler Peak promises an unforgettable experience. 

Named after George Montague Wheeler, a pioneering surveyor who led expeditions in the late 19th century, the peak is part of the Taos Ski Valley and lies within the Carson National Forest. For years, the Truchas Peaks, located south of Wheeler Peak, were considered the New Mexico highpoint. In 1948, a survey conducted by Harold D. Walker confirmed Wheeler Peak as the highest point in the state. The area is steeped in Native American history, particularly the Taos Pueblo people, who have lived in the region for centuries and regard the mountain as sacred. Big horn sheep are abundant but are wary of visitors.

The most popular route to Wheeler Peak is the Williams Lake Trail, an approximately 8-mile round trip with a 3,000-foot elevation gain. Starting from the Williams Lake Trailhead, the hike initially leads you through a beautiful forest before reaching the picturesque Williams Lake. From there, the trail becomes steeper as you ascend towards the summit of Wheeler Peak. A sub-peak north of Wheeler Peak named Walker is often mistaken for Wheeler. The final stretch involves a series of switchbacks and rocky terrain, so be prepared for a strenuous climb. The breathtaking views from the summit, including the Taos Ski Valley and surrounding peaks, are well worth the effort.

When hiking Wheeler Peak, please adhere to the following regulations to preserve the natural environment:

For those interested in camping, the Carson National Forest offers numerous campgrounds. Backcountry camping is permitted without fees or permits, but the Carson National Forest has a 14-day camping limit.

However, the first two miles of the Williams Lake Trail are on private property, so no camping is allowed at Williams Lake. The Twining Campground, located near the trailhead, is a convenient alternative.
