Woodall Mountain, located in the far eastern reaches of Mississippi, is a modest elevation that withstood the test of time against erosion. Its claim to fame is that it's the highest point in Mississippi, earning it a special place in the hearts of visitors. The mountain was initially named Yow Hill but was renamed in 1878 to honor Zephaniah Woodall, the sheriff of Tishomingo County at the time.

Woodall Mountain was the historic site of the Civil War's Battle of Iuka on 19 September 1862. The battle was fierce:

"The Union troops crested a hill, they paused, finding themselves above a densely wooded ravine crawling with Confederate forces. The ensuing combat saw relentless assaults up the hill, including the capture of a six-gun Ohio battery by the Confederates. The Union forces counterattacked from the ridge, and the intense battle raged on until darkness fell."

While it remains uncertain if this hill was Woodall Mountain, the area between the mountain's eastern and western summits does feature a brushy ravine, suggesting a possible connection. This site stands out as the most battle-scarred highpoint in the U.S. By the end of the conflict, approximately 4,500 Union soldiers had successfully driven about 3,200 Confederate troops from Iuka to Corinth, MS. The two armies clashed again in October 1862, with the Union securing victory.
