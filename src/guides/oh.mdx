Campbell Hill is part of the Ohio Hi-Point Career Center campus and named after Charles D. Campbell, who owned the land in the late 19th century. The hill has served various roles over the years, including a strategic military site that housed the 664th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron during the Cold War. This radar station was part of the U.S. Air Defense Command, monitoring for potential air attacks. The property was later repurposed for educational use and now hosts the Ohio Hi-Point Career Center.
