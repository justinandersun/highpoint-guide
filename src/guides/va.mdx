Mount Rogers is the highest peak in Virginia, the second-most prominent and second-most isolated peak in the state, the 19th-highest state highpoint, and the fourth-highest east of the Mississippi River. Interestingly, it is the highest eastern state highpoint without any roads or pavement leading to its summit, making it a true hiker's destination.

Due to its popularity, Grayson Highlands State Park was established near Mount Rogers in 1965. The following year, the United States Congress created the Mount Rogers National Recreational Area (NRA) to protect the region's natural landscape. The Mount Rogers summit is the centerpiece of the NRA, the highest point in the Lewis Fork Wilderness, and the George Washington-Jefferson National Forest. The mountain is also the highest point of the New River and Kanawha River drainage basins, with the nearest higher peak being Grandfather Mountain, over 40 miles away in North Carolina.

Mount Rogers is home to one of the few remaining high-altitude Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests, featuring Fraser firs, a rare evergreen tree found only above 5,500 feet in a few locations in the Appalachian Mountains. Unfortunately, these forests have been declining due to the balsam woolly adelgid, an invasive insect that first infested the area in 1962.

Visitors to Mount Rogers from Grayson Highlands State Park (Massie Gap) will likely encounter wild ponies, a significant attraction in the area. These Shetland ponies were introduced to manage the spread of native hawthorn and thrive above 4500' elevation. The population, managed by the Wilburn Ridge Pony Association, is kept around 120 through an annual adoption auction at Grayson Highland Fall Fest. The ponies, frequently seen between Massie Gap and Thomas Knob Shelter, are comfortable around humans, though touching and feeding them is prohibited by park policy.
