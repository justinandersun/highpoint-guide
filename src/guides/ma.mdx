Mount Greylock, nestled in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, is the state's tallest peak. Despite its modest height, Greylock boasts some of the most picturesque landscapes in the Eastern United States. It's so captivating that it's rumored to have inspired Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*, with its elongated, saddle-like silhouette visible from the author's observation deck in nearby Pittsfield.

The allure of Mount Greylock becomes evident upon visiting, its prominence undeniable as it towers nearly 2,700 feet above Adams, Massachusetts. Its vibrant colors and steep ascent into the sky distinguish it from other New England peaks, a characteristic of its Monadnock status—a mountain that rises abruptly from its surroundings.

Visitors can reach the summit by car or choose from several hiking trails, with the quickest ascent taking less than 90 minutes. While a summit tower is present, grimy windows obscure the views, so it’s not worth the climb. The surrounding viewpoints are more captivating.
