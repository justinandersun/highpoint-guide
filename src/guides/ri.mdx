Jerimoth Hill, Rhode Island's highest point, is a rock in the woods.

For years, Jerimoth Hill was known for its restricted access. Previously, it was open to the public only a few times a year, and there were instances of landowners taking extreme measures against unauthorized visitors. Since Brown University acquired it in 2012 and transferred ownership to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management in October 2014, access has become much more visitor-friendly.

The area around Jerimoth Hill is scenic, characterized by lush trees and tranquil lakes. The summit is a prominent rock located 200 yards from the road--a brief walk that takes less than five minutes and involves an elevation gain of ten feet.

Located roughly an hour south of Boston, Jerimoth Hill is accessible via Rhode Island Route 101. From I-395, take the exit for Route 101 near East Killingly, Connecticut. Follow Route 101 East, pass a small lake at the foot of a large hill, and look for a small sandy parking area on the left at the hill's crest. The highpoint is directly across the road. In 2005, the Highpointers Club constructed a short trail from the parking area to the summit.
