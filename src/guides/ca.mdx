Mount Whitney, located in the California Sierra Nevada, is the highest peak in the contiguous United States, standing at 14,505 feet. Whitney is the highpoint of both Tulare and Inyo counties and is the tallest peak in California and the Sierra Nevada. The National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and National Oceanographic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have frequently reassessed the elevation, with the current official height as 14,505 feet.

Despite its impressive height, Mount Whitney lacks the glaciers and extreme altitudes in the Earth's great mountain ranges. Nevertheless, it attracts numerous hikers, many of whom may not possess extensive wilderness skills, who tackle the summit via the famous Mount Whitney Trail. The mountain's appeal lies in its rich history, dramatic east face, and various routes available, including technical climbs and winter sports.

Mount Whitney has a rich history interwoven with the spirit of exploration and scientific inquiry. The first recorded ascent in 1873 by Charles Begole, John Lucas, and A. H. Johnson marked the beginning of its allure for climbers and adventurers. The mountain's unique position in the Eastern Sierra has made it a point of fascination for its height and geological and meteorological significance. The Smithsonian Institute Shelter, built in 1904, is a testament to the scientific research conducted at high altitudes, providing insights into weather patterns and atmospheric conditions.

Over the years, Mount Whitney has inspired numerous adventurers, including the legendary Badwater Ultramarathon participants who trek from the depths of Death Valley to the peak. The juxtaposition of the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States highlights the dramatic geography of the region. The mountain's subsidiary peaks and needles, particularly on the eastern face, are also notable for their challenging climbs and stunning views, offering mountaineers a diverse range of experiences.

The trailhead for Mount Whitney, known as Whitney Portal, can be accessed via US-395 from Lone Pine. From there, a 13-mile drive along Whitney Portal Road leads to the trailhead at 8,365 feet. The area is known for bear activity, so it is crucial not to leave food in vehicles, especially during bear season. In winter, the last 6 miles of the road may remain unplowed, adding an extra challenge for access.

The most common route to the summit is the **Mount Whitney Trail**, a strenuous 22-mile round trip with an elevation gain of over 6,000 feet. The trail starts at Whitney Portal and ascends through a series of ecosystems, from dense forests to alpine zones. Key landmarks along the way include:

1. **Lone Pine Lake** (2.8 miles from the trailhead): A picturesque spot and a good place for a break.
2. **Outpost Camp** (3.8 miles): An excellent location for those wanting a more leisurely ascent with an overnight stay.
3. **Trail Camp** (6.2 miles): The most popular campsite for summit attempts, situated at 12,000 feet. This location allows hikers to acclimate to the high altitude before the final push.
4. **The 99 Switchbacks**: A challenging segment leading up to Trail Crest, offering expansive views.
5. **Trail Crest** (8.2 miles): The highest point on the trail before the summit approach, where hikers can see the rugged eastern Sierra.
6. **Summit** (11 miles): The final ascent involves a mix of rocky terrain and breathtaking views, culminating at the highest point in the contiguous United States.

For those seeking a more technical challenge, the **Mountaineer's Route** provides a steeper and less-traveled alternative, requiring experience with rock climbing and winter equipment such as crampons and ice axes.
