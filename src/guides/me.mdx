Katahdin, Maine's highest mountain and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, stands proudly in Baxter State Park. This park is known for its "wilderness first" approach, earning it the nickname "the 51st state. Rising a mile above sea level, Katahdin dramatically overshadows the surrounding Maine lakes and forests. Its timberline, influenced by the northern latitude, begins at about 3,500 feet.

The most striking view of the mountain is from the south, where it resembles a granite fortress reaching skyward. Katahdin's shape is a horseshoe opening to the northeast. Along this horseshoe, five major peaks are arranged counterclockwise from the north: Howe Peak, Hamlin Peak, Baxter Peak (the summit), South Peak, and Pamola Peak. The Knife Edge, a narrow, jagged escarpment, is Katahdin's most striking feature. Stretching from South Peak to Pamola Peak, it provides an unforgettable and challenging traverse. Because of its iconic status, Katahdin attracts many climbers.

Contrary to its volcanic appearance, with cirque formations resembling craters, Katahdin is composed of granite sculpted over time by glacial erosion.

The story of the mountain's ascent began with surveyor Charles Turner Jr. who first climbed it via the Hunt Spur on August 2, 1804. Katahdin's allure was also captured by American author Henry David Thoreau, who described his 1846 ascent in "The Maine Woods."

## Access Point

To reach Katahdin, take Interstate 95 and exit at Millinocket-Mattawamkeag, approximately 50 miles north of Bangor, Maine. Follow the signs to Millinocket. Once there, turn right at the high school onto Katahdin Avenue. After a few blocks, turn left at the Baxter State Park sign. Continue for about 16 miles to the park. Choose either Perimeter Road (left) or Roaring Brook Road (right) to reach your chosen trailhead. Remember, in keeping with Governor Percival P. Baxter's vision for preserving wilderness, the park's gravel roads can be quite rugged.

## Recommended Route

Katahdin offers multiple routes to its summit, involving varying degrees of scrambling (second to fourth class) from three main directions: north, east, and southwest. For detailed technical routes (rock and ice), refer to the Routes section. Within the Great Basin cirque, Chimney Pond Campsite serves as a strategic starting point. Options from here include the Cathedral Ridge Route (1.7 miles) west of Baxter Peak, the more gentle Saddle Trail (2.2 miles), or the challenging Knife Edge (1.1 miles) via the Dudley Trail to Pamola Peak (1.3 miles). Alternatively, the Hamlin Ridge Trail (2.2 miles) leads to Hamlin Peak for a comprehensive western ascent.

The eastern approach begins at Roaring Brook Campground, following the Helon Taylor Trail (4.3 miles to summit), leading directly to Pamola Peak and the Knife Edge.

From the southwest, start at Abol or Katahdin Stream Campgrounds, following the Hunt Trail (5.2 miles total), which includes the Appalachian Trail's northernmost 5.5 miles.

A northern approach from Trout Brook is possible but extends beyond a day's hike.

## Regulations

Baxter State Park strictly regulates visitor numbers. Arrive early for climbing or camping, as even 6 AM can be too late during peak season.

Entrance to the park requires a fee of $14. Inside Baxter, adhere to rules designed to protect wildlife. The official season is May 15 to October 15. While a full gear set was previously mandatory outside this period, now only a working flashlight is essential.

Before hiking, register at the campgrounds with your names, chosen route, and expected return time. Also, sign in at Chimney Pondâ€™s hut upon arrival and departure. This procedure ensures ranger support and safety.

## Camping

Camping in Baxter State Park is by reservation only in designated areas. Reservations open four months in advance and are highly competitive, especially for summer dates. Maine residents receive priority. Plan early; for instance, booking in January for a late September climb may still only secure your 12th choice site. Last-minute reservations (within 10 days) are possible by phone but are less likely to be successful.
