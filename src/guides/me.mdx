Katahdin, Maine's highest mountain and the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, is a gigantic slab of granite sculpted by glacial erosion. Katahdin stands proudly in Baxter State Park, known for its wilderness-first approach, earning it the nickname "The 51st state.” Rising a mile above sea level, Katahdin dramatically overshadows the surrounding lakes and forests. Influenced by the northern latitude, its timberline begins at about 3,500 feet.

Katahdin is shaped like a horseshoe opening to the northeast. Along this horseshoe, five major peaks are arranged counterclockwise from the north: Howe Peak, Hamlin Peak, Baxter Peak (the summit), South Peak, and Pamola Peak. The Knife Edge, a narrow, jagged escarpment stretching from South Peak to Pamola Peak, is Katahdin's most striking feature, providing an unforgettable traverse.

The first official summit was by surveyor Charles Turner Jr. via the Hunt Spur on 2 August 1804. Henry David Thoreau captured Katahdin’s allure in "The Maine Woods” after his 1846 ascent.

To reach Katahdin, take Interstate 95 and exit at Millinocket-Mattawamkeag, approximately 50 miles north of Bangor, Maine. Follow the signs to Millinocket. Once there, turn right at the high school onto Katahdin Avenue. After a few blocks, turn left at the Baxter State Park sign. Continue for about 16 miles to the park. Choose either Perimeter Road (left) or Roaring Brook Road (right) to reach the trailhead. The park's rugged gravel roads follow Governor Baxter's vision for preserving wilderness.

Katahdin offers multiple routes to its summit, involving varying degrees of scrambling. The recommended eastern approach begins at Roaring Brook Campground, following the Helon Taylor Trail (4.3 miles to summit), leading directly to Pamola Peak and the Knife Edge.

## Regulations
Entrance to the park requires a fee of $14.

Baxter State Park strictly regulates visitor numbers to preserve the wilderness, so please adhere to the posted rules. Be sure to arrive early, as even 06:00 AM can be too late during peak season.

The official season is from 15 May to 15 October, and while full gear was previously mandatory outside this period, now only a working flashlight is essential.

Before hiking, sign in at the Chimney Pond Hut with your name, chosen route, and expected return time. Please sign out upon departure.

## Camping & Lodging
Camping in Baxter State Park is by reservation only in designated areas. Reservations open four months in advance and are highly competitive, especially for summer dates, and Maine residents receive priority. Last-minute reservations (within ten days) are possible by phone but are unlikely to be successful.

We recommend booking a hotel in Millinocket, such as <a href="https://live.ipms247.com/booking/book-rooms-katahdininnsuites">Katahdin Inn & Suites</a>.
