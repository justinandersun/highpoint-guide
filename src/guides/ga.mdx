Brasstown Bald, (also known as Enotah) is the highest mountain in the state of Georgia. The Southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail is little more than 30 miles southwest of Brasstown Bald at Springer Mountain. For armchair hikers, the mountain is accessible via a 1/2 mile paved trail to the summit, but longer trails are available (see "Trails to the summit" section). Brasstown Bald is not far from the North Carolina border, and lies in the heart of the Southern Appalachian Mountain chain. It is about an hour and a half north of Atlanta, but on a good night, you will find some of the clearest, and greatest viewpoints of the stars in the entire country. The area is most beautiful in late fall and early winter. In January of 2002, I found the summit to rival Glacier National Park in Montana in the majesty of its night sky!

No matter how you hike it, this is one of the most enjoyable Eastern U.S. highpoints. A large summit tower provides 360 degree panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, which are quite impressive, rising upwards of 2,500 feet from the surrounding valley and towns. Because of its proximity to the Appalachian trail, it makes an excellent side trip for a multi-day hike in the area.

## Getting There
Brasstown Bald and its trail entrances can be reached easily from the cities of Atlanta, Chattanooga, and Greenville. The parking area is reached via the 180 spur off of GA 180.

From Atlanta, take rt. 19 North to GA 180 eastward, and take it to the 180 spur, or continue on rt. 19 North until you hit rt. 76, which you can take East until Track Rock Road to get to the arkaquah trail.

From Chattanooga, take I-75 South into Georgia, and then take rt. 76 East to 19/129 South, to GA 180 eastward, and take it to the 180 spur. To get to the arkaquah trail, continue on rt. 76 East, until you reach Track Rock Road.

From Greenville, take rt. 123 to rt. 76 West, to 17/75 South to GA 180 westward, and take it to the 180 spur. To get to the arkaquah trail, continue on rt. 76 West, until you reach Track Rock Road.

## Recommended Route
Brasstown Bald Trail is the shortest, easiest trail to the summit. Take the paved trail and turn onto a dirt road, that leads up to the summit tower. There is a free shuttle to the top from the parking area for those who wish not to hike.

## Red Tape
It cost $5 per person (free for children under age 13) for visitors at the Brasstown Bald parking area, to hike the short Brasstown Bald trail.

## Camping
There is plenty of camping in the surrounding forests, but Brasstown Bald does not have any campsites on the mountain itself. However, you may camp on the Appalachian Trail, which can be accessed if you take the Jack Knob's trail for 1.5 miles in the opposite direction from the trail to Brasstown Bald.
