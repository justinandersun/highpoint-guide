Brasstown Bald, also known as Enotah, is the highest mountain in Georgia. About 30 miles southwest of the Southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail at Springer Mountain, Brasstown Bald offers a range of hiking options. The mountain is accessible via a half-mile paved trail to the summit, but longer trails are also available. Situated near the North Carolina border, in the heart of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, Brasstown Bald is approximately an hour and a half north of Atlanta. On clear nights, it provides some of the best stargazing opportunities in the country. The area is stunning in late fall and early winter, with views rivaling Glacier National Park's night skies.
