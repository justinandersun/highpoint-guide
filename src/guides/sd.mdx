Black Elk Peak, formerly called Harney Peak, stands at 7,242 feet and is the highest point in South Dakota. Located within the Black Hills National Forest, this peak offers hikers breathtaking views, rich history, and a chance to explore one of the most iconic summits between the Rockies and the Pyrenees. The peak is renowned for its panoramic vistas and the historic fire lookout tower at the summit.

Following a ruling by the U.S. Board of Geographic Names on August 11, 2016, the peak was renamed to honor Black Elk, a revered Oglala Sioux medicine man who had a vision on the summit. Black Elk Peak holds significant cultural and spiritual value for the Lakota people.

The peak is the highest summit in a line between the Rocky Mountains and the Pyrenees in France. The granite mountain and its surrounding range rose during the Laramide orogeny between 40 and 60 million years ago. Despite being below the treeline, the summit is bare rock, offering uninhibited and spectacular views.

From Rapid City, SD, for the Sylvan Lake approach, take Highway 16 west for about 30 miles to Hill City, SD. Drive through Hill City on Highway 16, about 3.2 miles out of town, and turn east onto Highway 87. Follow this for 6.1 miles to Sylvan Lake recreation area on the north side of the road, which is in Custer State Park. 

Trail 9 South and Trail 4 both start at different places along the large parking lot on the east side of Sylvan Lake. For the Willow Creek approach, take the same drive to Hill City, then follow Highway 16 south out of Hill City, and after 3 miles out of town, turn east onto Highway 244. Follow this for about 3 miles to the Willow Creek Horse Camp on the south side of the road. The trail starts on the east side of the day-use area.

Not many hikers use Norbeck Trail 3 or Grizzly Bear Trail 7 to reach Black Elk Peak, but the trailheads for both of those trails sit along Forest Road 345 and are accessible from Highway 87, the Needles Highway, eight miles southeast of Sylvan Lake.

There are multiple routes to the summit, and the Black Elk Wilderness Map (available for free from the Black Hills National Forest) details those routes. The most commonly used route is Trail 9 South from Sylvan Lake. This route is approximately 3.8 miles one way with about 1,000 feet of relative elevation gain from trailhead to summit, making it an easy to moderate hike.

Trail 4 from Sylvan Lake also sees quite a bit of traffic. It is about the same distance to the summit but follows a more southerly route by the Little Devils Tower and Cathedral Spires, with short spur trails to each. Trail 4 also has a second trailhead along the Needles Highway about 1 mile southeast of Sylvan Lake. From Sylvan Lake to where Trail 4 joins Trail 3 (which then joins Trail 9 South), it's 2.3 miles. It is approximately another 1.4 miles from that junction to the peak's summit.

The northern approach is longer but more scenic. This route starts at the Willow Creek Horse Camp and follows Trail 9 North for 5 miles to the summit, with about 2,200 feet of relative elevation gain. This trailhead is more accessible from the Rapid City area than the southern route. Both trails are well-marked and easy to follow.

## Regulations
No climbing permits are required. Black Elk Peak lies in the Black Elk Wilderness, within the Norbeck Wildlife Preserve in the Black Hills National Forest. There is a counter at the trailhead that records all people coming through. Get a free map from the local Forest Service offices. Although Black Elk Peak lies in the Black Elk Wilderness, the Sylvan Lake trailheads are in Custer State Park, which requires a per-person and vehicle entry fee.

## Camping
No camping is permitted in the day-use area at Willow Creek, but you can simply grab your tent and walk into the forest to camp there. The NFS prohibits camping within a quarter-mile of the summit. There are many great locations north and south of the summit. Camping is also available in Custer State Park, with options ranging from developed campgrounds to backcountry sites. Nearby Sylvan Lake Lodge offers cabins and lodge rooms for those seeking more comfortable accommodations. Additional lodging exists in Custer and Hill City.

## FAQs

### What should I bring for the hike?
Bring plenty of water, snacks, a day pack, comfortable hiking boots, layered clothing, a hat, sunscreen, trekking poles, and a map or GPS device. It's also advisable to bring a first aid kit and weather-appropriate gear.

### Is the hike suitable for beginners?
The hike is considered moderate and suitable for beginners in good physical condition. The trail is well-marked and maintained. However, beginners should be prepared for a steady elevation gain and a longer distance if choosing the whole loop.

### When is the best time to hike Black Elk Peak?
The best times to hike are in the spring and fall when temperatures are mild. Summer hikes are enjoyable but can be crowded. Winter hikes offer solitude but require preparation for snowy and icy conditions.

### Are pets allowed on the trail?
Yes, pets are allowed but must remain leashed. Ensure you bring enough water and supplies for your pet, too.

### Why was Harney Peak renamed to Black Elk Peak?
Black Elk Peak was originally named Harney Peak after General William S. Harney, a U.S. Army officer involved in conflicts with Native American tribes. In 2016, it was renamed Black Elk Peak to honor Black Elk, a revered Lakota holy man known for his spiritual visions and efforts to preserve Lakota culture. The change acknowledged the mountainâ€™s significance to Indigenous people and moved away from a name associated with violent colonial history.
