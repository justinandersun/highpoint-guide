Mount Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak, stands as a prominent feature in Chittenden County. Its unique summit ridge, visible from the east, resembles a human face, with distinct parts named accordingly: Adams Apple (4,060 feet), Chin (4,393 feet, the highest point), Nose (4,062 feet), and Forehead (3,940 feet). The Long Trail, spanning approximately 2.3 miles from Adams Apple to Forehead, boasts a rare alpine zone stretch in Vermont. It's crucial to stick to the trail to protect the fragile vegetation. Mount Mansfield is a popular destination, attracting nearly 40,000 visitors annually, which impacts its delicate ecosystem. Notably, it's one of two places in Vermont where Arctic Tundra exists, featuring about 200 acres on Mount Mansfield.

The mountain's weather can drastically differ from the surrounding lower areas. In winter, the summit often experiences blowing snow and clouds. Above the treeline, whiteouts are common, posing risks of disorientation. Visibility can drop to a mere 20 feet, making it easy to lose one's way. In such conditions, it's safer to choose less exposed routes, like the Laura Cowles Trail, instead of the more open Sunset Ridge.

## Access Point
To reach the Long Trail (LT) and Haselton Trail trailheads, head north on VT 100 to Stowe, then take VT 108. The Haselton Trail begins at the Gondola Base Lodge parking lot, and the LT trailhead is 0.6 miles further north.

For the Sunset Ridge Trail, start at Underhill State Park. From Underhill Center, follow Pleasant Valley Road for about a mile north, then take Mountain Road to the state park (parking fees apply). From the park, follow the old CCC road for a mile to where the trail diverges left off the road.

## Recommended Route
Mount Mansfield offers several popular routes. From the west, Underhill State Park is a common starting point, with popular trails including Sunset Ridge and Laura Cowles. From the east, the Long Trail is frequently chosen. The easiest ascent, however, is via the Toll Road.

## Regulations
The State of Vermont closes Mount Mansfield's trails from mid-April to Memorial Day to protect both the vegetation and trails from erosion. The Green Mountain Club advises against high-elevation hiking during this period.

There are no fees or permits required, except if using the toll road or gondola.

## Accommodations
Most visitors complete the climb in a day given the mountain's manageable size. For overnight stays, the Green Mountain Club's Taft Lodge is available. The lodge charges $6 per person. Visitors should bring their own stove and toilet paper, as fires are prohibited and the outhouse might lack supplies. Although water is available, it's from an untested source, so bringing a water filter is advisable.
