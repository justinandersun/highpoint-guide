Mount Mansfield, Vermont's highest peak, is a prominent feature in Chittenden County. Its unique summit ridge resembles a human face, with distinct parts named accordingly: Adams Apple (4,060 feet), Chin (4,393 feet, the highest point), Nose (4,062 feet), and Forehead (3,940 feet). The Long Trail, spanning approximately 2.3 miles from Adams Apple to Forehead, is one of two places in Vermont where Arctic Tundra exists. Mount Mansfield is a popular destination, attracting nearly 40,000 visitors annually, so it's crucial to stick to the trail to protect the fragile vegetation.

The mountain's weather can drastically differ from the surrounding lower areas. In winter, the summit often experiences blowing snow and clouds. Above the tree line, whiteouts are common, posing risks of disorientation. Visibility can drop to a mere 20 feet, making it easy to lose one's way. In such conditions, choosing less exposed routes, like the Laura Cowles Trail, is safer than the more open Sunset Ridge.
