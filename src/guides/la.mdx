Mountains are the last thing that comes to mind when most Americans think of Louisiana. The state is one of three in the U.S., with its lowest point below sea level, and its highest point is the third lowest in the country. Only Florida's Britton Hill and Delaware's Ebright Azimuth are lower than this 163-meter (535-foot) elevation. Driskill Mountain dwells in the densely forested Piney Woods of East Texas and Louisiana, known for its logging operations and ferrous sandstone that gives the soil a reddish tint. While temperatures rarely drop below freezing in winter, the region typically experiences one significant snowstorm in late February or early March.

Driskill Mountain's namesake is James Christopher Driskill, a local landowner and farmer who settled in the area in the 19th century. The peak symbolizes Northern Louisiana's natural beauty and heritage as the mountain and surrounding areas have been used for logging, shaping the local landscape and economy. With their dense forests and rich soil, the Piney Woods have supported a vibrant community rooted in forestry and agriculture.
