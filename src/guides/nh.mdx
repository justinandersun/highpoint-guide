Mount Washington, affectionately known as "the Rock Pile," stands as the highest peak of New Hampshire. Renowned in New England for hiking, backcountry skiing, alpine climbing, and ice climbing, it is nestled just west of NH SR-16, between North Conway to the south and Gorham. Famous for having "the World's Worst Weather" and holding the record for the highest wind speed recorded by man (231 mph on April 12, 1934), Mount Washington is a prominent feature in the Presidential Range. The range includes New England's five highest peaks, but initially, the entire massif was known as Mount Washington, stretching 30 miles east to west. It wasn't until the 19th century that the surrounding peaks like Adams, Jefferson, and Madison were individually named. The mountain is equipped with a cog railway and a road, leading to an observatory, museum, and snack shop at the summit.

## Access Point
The Pinkham Notch Visitor Center serves as the primary starting point for climbing Mount Washington. It is best for accessing trails like Tuckerman Ravine, Huntington Ravine, Lion Head, and Boot Spur, and is conveniently located halfway between Gorham and North Conway on Route 16. For the auto road, head to the Glen House north of the Notch. To reach the cog railroad, take Mt. Clinton Road from Bretton Woods to Marshfield Station, following signs near the Mt. Washington Hotel.

## Recommended Route
From the summit parking lot, a short walk leads to the famed rock pile.

Mount Washington offers a variety of hiking, ice, and ski routes, along with a few rock climbing paths. The hiking trails approach from all directions, while ice climbing is mainly focused in Huntington Ravine, with additional routes in Tuckerman Ravine and the Great Gulf.

## Regulations
The White Mountain National Forest requires a parking pass for many trailheads. A pass is necessary for parking in the National Forest, including the overflow lots at Pinkham Notch. However, the Pinkham Notch parking lot itself does not require a pass. Passes range from a $20 annual fee to a $3 daily fee.

## Camping
Established camping spots are available at the Hermit Lake Shelters, the AMC Lakes of the Clouds Hut (at 5,012 feet), and the Harvard Cabin. The Lakes of the Clouds Hut, situated a mile southwest of Tuckerman Junction on the mountain, offers full services from June 1 to September 15. In winter, a small emergency "refuge room" provides shelter from harsh conditions. The Harvard Cabin, about 2.1 miles from Pinkham Notch in Huntington Ravine, operates only in winter (December 1 to March 31). It charges $15/night for indoor stays and $7.50/night for camping outside. The cabin accommodates approximately 16 people, offering a gas stove, wood stove, pots, and utensils, with a caretaker on-site for assistance and fee collection. Overnight stays require registration in the logbook at the AMC Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, with availability on a first-come, first-served basis. Note that pets are not permitted for overnight stays.
