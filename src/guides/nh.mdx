Mount Washington, affectionately known as "the Rock Pile," stands as the highest peak in New Hampshire. Renowned in New England for hiking, backcountry skiing, alpine climbing, and ice climbing, it is nestled just west of NH SR-16, between North Conway to the south and Gorham.

Famous for having "the World's Worst Weather" and holding the record for the highest wind speed ever recorded (231 mph on 12 April 1934), Mount Washington is a prominent feature in the Presidential Range. The range includes New England's five highest peaks, but initially, the entire massif was known as Mount Washington, stretching 30 miles from east to west. It wasn't until the 19th century that the surrounding peaks like Adams, Jefferson, and Madison were individually named. The mountain has a cog railway and a road leading to an observatory, museum, and snack shop at the summit.

## Regulations
The White Mountain National Forest requires a parking pass for many trailheads. A pass is necessary for parking in the National Forest, including the overflow lots at Pinkham Notch. However, the Pinkham Notch parking lot itself does not require a pass. Passes range from a $20 annual fee to a $3 daily fee.

## Camping & Lodging
Established camping spots are available at the Hermit Lake Shelters, the AMC Lakes of the Clouds Hut (at 5,012 feet), and the Harvard Cabin.

The Lakes of the Clouds Hut, situated a mile southwest of Tuckerman Junction on the mountain, offers services from 1 June to 15 September. A small emergency "refuge room" provides shelter from harsh conditions in winter.

The Harvard Cabin, about 2.1 miles from Pinkham Notch in Huntington Ravine, operates only in winter (1 December to 31 March). It charges $15/night for indoor stays and $7.50/night for camping outside. The cabin accommodates approximately 16 people, offering a gas stove, wood stove, pots, and utensils, with a caretaker on-site for assistance and fee collection.

Overnight stays require registration in the logbook at the AMC Pinkham Notch Visitor Center, with availability on a first-come, first-served basis. Pets are not permitted for overnight stays.
