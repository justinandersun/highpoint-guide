Space Mountain isn't Florida's highest peak, though it might claim the title for most expensive! Instead, nestled in the western nook of the Panhandle lies the unassuming Britton Hill. It's the true crowning glory of Florida's topography, albeit the lowest highpoint in the United States. Chances are, where you’re sitting is loftier than Britton Hill. But why trek to this geographical quirk? Well, it's not just any highpoint; it's *Florida's* highpoint.

Named after a retired postmistress, Britton Hill is the gem of a county park in Paxton, Florida. The highpoint lounges less than 50 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, flanked by charming, hilly roads near the Alabama border. It's a quaint forested blip, standing 50 feet proud above the surrounding farmland, and bizarrely enough, it's in the Central Time Zone.

Fear not; the journey to Britton Hill is easygoing. Cruise along I-10 in the Florida Panhandle, jump off at Route 331 near De Funiak Springs and follow it northward for 20 miles. Keep your eyes peeled for a sign pointing toward Florida’s high point. From there, it’s a short 3-mile jaunt to the parking lot, just shy of the border. Missed the hill? If you find yourself in Alabama, you've gone too far!

As you near the park, you'll tackle a steep hill, a rare Florida experience! At the summit, a sign on the left marks the spot. Park, stretch your legs, and stroll over to the stone marker declaring the highpoint. Fancy a bit more adventure? There's a nature trail beyond beckoning for a leisurely hike.

If you're itching for more nature, keep rolling into Alabama and hang a left on Route 54 towards Florala. Lake Jackson, a bi-state aquatic haven, is less than 3 miles from Britton Hill. It's the perfect spot to reflect on your ascent to the top of Florida.

## Recommended Route
None! You'll see the marker from the parking lot.
