Cheaha, meaning "high place" in the Muscogee language, is nestled in the Talladega National Forest. Standing at just over 2,400 feet, it boasts the highest elevation in Alabama. You'll find a campground, hotel, and state-operated convenience store at the summit. Despite its moderate height, Cheaha Mountain offers stunning views, excellent climbing opportunities with various difficulty levels, and convenient top-roping.
