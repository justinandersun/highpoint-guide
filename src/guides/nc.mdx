Mount Mitchell, located about 35 miles northeast of Asheville in North Carolina's Black Mountains, is the highest peak in the United States east of the Mississippi River, standing at 6,684 feet. It is part of the Black Mountain Crest, which includes six other peaks above 6,300 feet, such as Mount Craig, the second-highest peak in the eastern U.S. The summit lies within Mount Mitchell State Park, while many approach trails, including the Mount Mitchell Trail, begin in the Pisgah National Forest. In the summer, hikers can enjoy a variety of blooming wildflowers, and trout fishing is popular in the nearby creeks.

In the early 20th century, several companies, including Brown Brothers, Carolina Spruce, Dickey and Campbell, and Perley and Crockett, heavily logged Mount Mitchell. They stripped most trees from the slopes of the Black Mountains and transported them by railroad to Pensacola, NC, and Black Mountain, NC. John Silcox Holmes and Locke Craig played vital roles in transforming the logged areas into a state park. In 1909, officials appointed Holmes as state forester, and he reported on the forest conditions. Craig, elected governor in 1913, helped pass a bill on March 3, 1915, to create a park on Mount Mitchell, establishing one of the first state or federal parks in the Southeast U.S.

During the logging and early years of the park, visitors could access the mountain by railroad from Black Mountain, NC. In 1922, a toll road replaced the tracks, and eventually, the Blue Ridge Parkway replaced the toll road from Buck Creek Gap to Black Mountain Gap in 1939.
