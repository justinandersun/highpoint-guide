Ebright Azimuth is the official name of Delaware's state highpoint. Although it might not be a traditional peak and isn't a primary destination for peak baggers, it holds significance as one of the 50 State Highpoints. Ebright Azimuth stands at an elevation of 448 feet, making it the second-lowest state highpoint in the United States, just about 100 feet higher than Florida's Britton Hill.

Ebright Azimuth sits along Ebright Road, approximately 500 feet from the Delaware-Pennsylvania border. It is a virtual drive-up highpoint, making it convenient for visitors. Three USGS Benchmark disks are in the vicinity, but only one, situated in a dirt cutout from a sidewalk along Ebright Road, is recommended for visits. The other two benchmarks are on private property, and both the Highpointers Club and the State of Delaware advise against visiting these due to privacy concerns of local property owners.
