Denali, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is the highest peak in North America and a coveted destination for high-altitude climbers. Rising majestically near the Arctic Circle and the Gulf of Alaska, Denali's notorious weather and rugged terrain make it an ideal training ground for those aspiring to tackle the world's highest peaks, including the 8,000-meter giants of the Himalayas. It's also a must-visit for peak baggers, being the highpoint of the Denali Borough, the state of Alaska, the United States, the Alaska Range, and North America.

Denali's first recorded ascent was in 1913, marking the beginning of its legacy as a premier mountaineering challenge. The mountain's extreme environment, with its significant relief and a rise of 17,000 feet from its surrounding plain, makes it a severe test of endurance, teamwork, and logistics. The climb's difficulty is further heightened by the mountain's latitude, which results in lower barometric pressure and a sensation of higher altitude than the actual elevation.

Denali holds a rich cultural and historical significance. It has been a sacred place for the native Koyukon Athabascan people, who named it "Denali," meaning "The Great One." This name reflects the mountain's towering presence and spiritual importance in their culture. The name "Mount McKinley" was given in 1896 by a prospector to honor then-presidential candidate William McKinley, though this name was often contested. In 2015, the mountain's official name was changed back to Denali to recognize the native name. The first successful ascent was made in 1913 by Hudson Stuck, Harry Karstens, Walter Harper, and Robert Tatum. Harper, an Alaskan native, was the first to set foot on the summit. The mountain has since become a symbol of adventure and a testing ground for climbers worldwide, drawing thousands each year who seek to conquer its formidable heights.

## Access Point
Given Denali’s remote location and extreme climate, getting to the mountain is a three-part journey.

### Part I: Flying to Anchorage
The journey to Denali begins at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC), located approximately four miles south of Anchorage. While not a significant passenger hub, it ranks as the world's fifth-largest cargo airport. Most climbers fly into Anchorage before making their way to the mountain.

### Part II: Driving to Talkeetna
A two-hour drive from Anchorage brings climbers to the small town of Talkeetna, the primary staging area for expeditions to Denali and the Alaska Range. As Talkeetna's options are limited, stocking up on supplies in Anchorage is advisable.

### Part III: Flying to the Kahiltna Glacier
Expeditions fly from Talkeetna to the Kahiltna Glacier Base Camp via bush plane. Some services offer flights from Anchorage to Talkeetna for an additional fee.

## Recommended Route
Take the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/alaska/mount-denali-west-buttress">West Buttress Route</a>.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/alaska/mount-denali-west-buttress?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

The West Buttress is the most popular route on Denali, attempted by over 90% of climbers. Despite being the "easiest" route technically, it remains a formidable challenge. The route's nicknames, such as "the Denali Iditarod" or "the Scenic Loop," reflect its popularity and accessibility. Climbers face numerous hazards, including crevasses, avalanches, and extreme weather, with critical sections like the lower glacier, Windy Corner, the Autobahn, Denali Pass, and the Summit Ridge requiring careful navigation.

Camps are typically established at various elevations: 7,200 ft (Base Camp), 7,800 ft, 9,500 ft, 11,000 ft, 14,200 ft, and 17,200 ft. The total horizontal distance is approximately 13 miles, with about 13,500 feet of vertical gain. Expeditions generally take around 17 days, but climbers should be prepared with supplies for up to three weeks.

## Itinerary
Summitting Denali can take many weeks, but here is a sample itinerary:
- **Day 1**: Land at Base Camp
- **Day 2**: Rest and organize gear
- **Day 3**: Move to 7,800 ft camp
- **Day 4**: Move to 9,500 ft camp
- **Day 5**: Move to 11,000 ft camp
- **Day 6**: Rest day
- **Day 7**: Ferry loads to 14,200 ft camp, return to 11,000 ft camp
- **Day 8**: Move to 14,200 ft camp
- **Day 9**: Rest day
- **Day 10**: Ferry loads to 17,200 ft camp, return to 14,200 ft
- **Day 11**: Rest day
- **Day 12**: Move to 17,200 ft camp
- **Day 13**: Summit day
- **Day 14**: Descend to 11,000 ft camp
- **Day 15**: Descend to base camp, fly out

This itinerary may vary due to weather conditions and the team's acclimatization rate.

## Regulations
Denali requires climbing permits and strict waste management requirements to ensure the integrity of the mountain’s ecosystem.

### Permits
Climbers must register with the Talkeetna Ranger Station at least 60 days before climbing and pay a permit fee ($375 for adults and $275 for those 24 and younger). The Denali National Park entrance fee is an additional $15 per person.

### Clean Mountain Canisters (CMCs)
All climbers must use CMCs to manage human waste. These portable toilets are crucial for maintaining a pristine environment. The National Park Service provides CMCs, which must be used throughout the climb, especially at High Camp.

### Waste Management
All trash and human waste must be carried off the mountain. The National Park Service strictly enforces these regulations, with fines and other penalties for violators.

## Gear
Climbing Denali requires specialized gear to ensure safety and comfort in extreme conditions. Essential equipment includes:
- **Clothing**: Layered clothing for temperature regulation, including base layers, insulating layers, and outer shell layers. A down suit or parka is recommended for the upper mountain.
- **Footwear**: Mountaineering boots suitable for extreme cold, with compatible crampons.
- **Sleeping System**: A four-season tent, a high-quality sleeping bag rated to at least -40°F, and a sleeping pad for insulation from the snow.
- **Technical Gear**: Ice axe, crampons, harnesses, ropes, and snow anchors for glacier travel and crevasse rescue.
- **Cooking and Hydration**: A reliable stove for melting snow, fuel, and high-calorie food that is easy to prepare in cold conditions.
- **Safety and Navigation**: GPS, map, compass, altimeter, and communication devices like a satellite phone or radio.
- Other essentials like sun protection (sunglasses, sunscreen), a personal first aid kit, and personal hygiene items.

After decades of advocacy, the name was officially changed back to Denali in 2015 to honor its original Native heritage.
