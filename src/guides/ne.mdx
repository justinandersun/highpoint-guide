Panorama Point, at an elevation of 5,429 feet, is the highest point in Nebraska. Located in the state's southwestern corner near the borders of Colorado and Wyoming, this spot offers expansive views of the Great Plains. While not a traditional hike, visiting Panorama Point provides a unique opportunity to experience the subtle beauty of Nebraska's landscape and witness a significant geographical marker. While this highpoint is atop a hill, it is difficult to tell precisely where the actual highpoint is. If not for the marker the Kimball Chamber of Commerce placed, one would have difficulty locating the true highpoint.

Discovered in October 1951 by Art Henrickson and Claude Alden using a WWI altimeter, Panorama Point was officially recognized as Nebraska's highest point by the federal government and mapping companies in 1971. The area is part of the High Point Bison Ranch, owned by Glen and Jill Klawonn, who welcome visitors to explore this unique site.

To reach Panorama Point from I-80, take exit eight just east of the Wyoming-Nebraska border and follow county roads through a series of turns: south on CR 17, west on CR 8, south on CR 9, west on CR 6, and finally south on CR 5. Look for signs indicating the turnoff to Panorama Point and follow the dirt road for about a mile to the high point marker. Visitors are requested to leave a $3 donation in the box provided at the entrance.

## Recommended Route
Visiting Panorama Point is more of a drive-up experience than a hike. After parking, a short walk will take you to the stone monument marking the high point. The area features a bench, a metal desk with a guest register, and stunning views of the surrounding plains. On clear days, you can even see the distant Rocky Mountains. The bison are frequently within the fences of this section, and it would be dangerous to walk the road the entire way without the safety of a vehicle nearby.
