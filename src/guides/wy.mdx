At 13,804 feet, Gannett Peak stands as Wyoming's highest point, outstripping the more famous Grand Teton by 34 feet. Nestled in the remote Wind River Range, approximately 70 miles southeast of Grand Teton, Gannett Peak is notable for its rugged terrain, extensive glaciers, and significant prominence and isolation.

Gannett Peak was named in 1906 in honor of Henry Gannett, a prominent geographer and one of the founders of the National Geographic Society. Known as the "Father of the Quadrangle," Gannett was instrumental in developing topographic mapping in the United States. The first recorded ascent was made in 1922 by Arthur Tate and Floyd Stahlnaker.

The peak is the highest point in two counties (Fremont and Sublette), two National Forests (Bridger-Teton and Shoshone), and two Wilderness Areas (Bridger and Fitzpatrick). It is also the most isolated peak in Wyoming and the ninth-most isolated in the contiguous United States, with a 290-mile distance from the nearest higher peak. Gannett Peak has a clean prominence of 7,076 feet, making it the most prominent peak in Wyoming and the 15th-most prominent in the contiguous USA.

From a mountaineering perspective, Gannett Peak presents a formidable challenge. It is considered one of the most difficult state highpoints, rivaled only by Denali, Mount Rainier, and Granite Peak. The mountain's rugged terrain, high elevation, and technical requirements demand high skill and preparation from climbers.

## Access Point
Gannett Peak offers two common approaches, one from the East and one from the West.

### Starting at Dubois, WY (Eastern Approach)

3. Pull into the Trails End Campground and Elkhart Park parking area, the starting point for the Pole Creek Trail.

### Recommended Route
Gannett Peak can be approached from the east via the Glacier Trail or the west via the Pole Creek Trail to Titcomb Basin. Each route has its unique challenges and scenic rewards.

### From the East (Glacier Trail)
**Distance:** 50 miles roundtrip  
**Elevation Gain:** Approximately 10,750 feet

Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/wyoming/gannett-peak-wyoming-highpoint">Glacier Trail</a>.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/wyoming/gannett-peak-wyoming-highpoint?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

Starting from Dubois, this route is the longest standard approach to any state highpoint in the contiguous United States. While the mileage and elevation gain are significant, the approach offers a closer high camp, making the summit day less demanding. Key waypoints include Arrow Pass, Double Lake, and the Dinwoody Glacier, with high camps near the glacier.
- **Trailhead:** Start at Trail Lake Ranch.
- **Arrow Pass (10,895 ft):** Ascend through switchbacks, reaching a high point with expansive views.
- **Burro Flat and Phillips Lake:** The trail descends into open plateaus, passing picturesque lakes.
- **Double Lake and Star Lake:** Ideal camping spots for the first night, with scenic views and access to water.
- **Dinwoody Glacier Base:** Establish high camp at around 10,200 to 10,800 feet.
- **Gooseneck Glacier:** Navigate crevasses and ascend to the summit ridge.
- **Summit:** The final push to the peak involves crossing a bergschrund and ascending steep snow slopes.

### From the West (Pole Creek Trail to Titcomb Basin)
**Distance:** 40 miles roundtrip  
**Elevation Gain:** Approximately 9,050 feet

Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/wyoming/titcomb-lakes-via-pole-creek-seneca-lake-and-indian-pass-trail">Pole Creek Trail</a> to Titcomb Basin. After the basin, the AllTrails routes disappear, so you'll have to ascend over Bonney Pass into the Dinwoody Basin on sparsely marked trails.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/wyoming/titcomb-lakes-via-pole-creek-seneca-lake-and-indian-pass-trail?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

The Western approach is popular due to its slightly shorter distance and less overall elevation gain. However, crossing Bonney Pass requires additional elevation loss and gain on summit day, adding to the route's difficulty. This route offers spectacular scenery, including views of the Titcomb Basin.
- **Trailhead:** Start at Elkhart Park.
- **Photographers Point:** A popular spot for views of the Wind River Range.
- **Seneca Lake and Island Lake:** Pass these beautiful alpine lakes en route to Titcomb Basin.
- **Titcomb Basin:** Set up base camp in this stunning location surrounded by towering peaks.
- **Bonney Pass (12,800 ft):** Climb over the pass, descending into Dinwoody Basin.
- **Dinwoody Glacier:** The route merges with the eastern approach, continuing up the glacier to the summit.

## Regulations
