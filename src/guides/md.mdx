Hoye Crest is the highest point in Maryland, making it a popular destination for state highpointers. Despite its prominence, Hoye Crest offers a relatively easy hike with rewarding views at the summit, making it an enjoyable experience for hikers of all levels.

Hoye Crest holds a special place in Maryland's geography and history. The mountain is part of the Appalachian Mountains and spans the Maryland and West Virginia border. The area is known for its rich natural beauty and has been a site for various outdoor activities. A commemorative sign marks the summit, and recent efforts to clear some trees have improved the views from the top. Additionally, nearby attractions, such as the smallest church in the lower 48 states in Silver Lake, West Virginia, add a touch of local charm to the visit.

To reach the trailhead for Hoye Crest from I-68, take Exit 14 and head south on US 219. After passing the junction with US 50 at Redhouse, Maryland, continue for 4.3 miles until you arrive in the village of Silver Lake, West Virginia. From there, continue south on US 219 for another 1.1 miles. Watch for trees with orange blazes on the left side of the road and a small sign marked "MD HP"—this indicates the trailhead. Parking is available on both sides of the road. Do not attempt to drive up the logging road, as it is rough and may be legally restricted.

## Recommended Route
Start at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/west-virginia/hoye-crest-backbone-mountain">Backbone Mountain Trailhead</a>.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/west-virginia/hoye-crest-backbone-mountain?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

From the roadside trailhead, begin hiking up the logging road. The hike takes about 20 minutes. Be sure you are following the route marked "MD HP," as multiple old logging roads in the area also have orange blazes and can be confusing. Do not rely solely on the orange blazes—look instead for red “HP” markings on trees to stay on the correct trail. Along the way, you’ll pass several red wooden signs reading "Highpoint, MD/WV Marker."

After approximately 0.75 miles, take a left onto a narrow footpath that branches off the logging road. The trail runs parallel to a metal fence bordering a private farm on your left as you climb.

Near the top, the path briefly splits: the grassy path to the right and the rocky path to the left both lead to the same point and rejoin shortly before the summit.

At the summit, you’ll find a sign marking Maryland’s highest point, a cleared area offering views to the east, and a picnic table. Rest and enjoy the scenery!

The hike is about 1 mile round-trip with a 700-foot elevation gain.
