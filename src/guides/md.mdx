Hoye Crest is the highest point in Maryland, making it a popular destination for state highpointers. Despite its prominence, Hoye Crest offers a relatively easy hike with rewarding views at the summit, making it an enjoyable experience for hikers of all levels.

Hoye Crest holds a special place in Maryland's geography and history. The mountain is part of the Appalachian Mountains and spans the Maryland and West Virginia border. The area is known for its rich natural beauty and has been a site for various outdoor activities. A commemorative sign marks the summit, and recent efforts to clear some trees have improved the views from the top. Additionally, nearby attractions, such as the smallest church in the lower 48 states in Silver Lake, West Virginia, add a touch of local charm to the visit.

To reach Hoye Crest from I-68, take Exit 14 and head south on US 219. After passing the junction with US 50 at Redhouse, MD, continue for 4.3 miles until you reach the village of Silver Lake, West Virginia. From Silver Lake, continue following US 219 South for 1.1 miles. Look for trees with orange blazes on the left side of the road and a marked sign "MD HP" indicating the trailhead. There are parking areas on both sides of the road. Driving up the logging road is not recommended due to rough conditions and legal restrictions.

## Recommended Route
Start at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/west-virginia/hoye-crest-backbone-mountain">Backbone Mountain Trailhead</a>.

<iframe class="alltrails" src="https://www.alltrails.com/widget/trail/us/west-virginia/hoye-crest-backbone-mountain?scrollZoom=false&elevationDiagram=false&u=i&sh=cmpl5n" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" title="AllTrails: Trail Guides and Maps for Hiking, Camping, and Running"></iframe>

From the trailhead, follow the logging road for about 20 minutes, ensuring you follow the orange blazes on the trees. Ignore a red sign pointing left early in the hike, as this is not the correct turn. After approximately 3/4 of a mile, take a left onto a well-cairned footpath off the logging road. The path briefly splits into grassy right and rocky left paths, but both converge shortly before reaching the summit. At the summit, you'll find a sign marking Maryland's highest point, a cleared area providing decent views to the east, and a picnic table for resting after the hike. The total hike is about 1 mile with a 700-foot vertical climb.

## Lodging & Camping
