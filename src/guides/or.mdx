Mount Hood, located about 50 miles east of Portland, Oregon, is one of North America's most climbed glaciated peaks and is considered the second most popular behind Japan's Fuji-san. This dormant volcano, last erupting in 1907, still has active fumaroles. Its relatively low altitude, straightforward approach, and short hiking/climbing distances make it accessible to less experienced climbers. However, this has led to a higher rate of accidents due to severe weather and inexperience. Skiers can descend directly from the summit, and dogs often make the ascent.

Mount Hood has been a revered site for indigenous tribes for centuries. Its rich history is reflected in the mountain's natural and cultural landscapes. The Timberline Lodge, constructed in 1937 as a Works Progress Administration project, is a significant historical and architectural landmark. Notably, the lodge was used for the exterior shots of the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film, *The Shining*. This cinematic history has added to the lodge's allure, attracting film enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers.

With its striking silhouette and volatile weather, the mountain has been a beacon for climbers and hikers. The variety of ecosystems, from dense forests at lower elevations to alpine meadows and glaciers near the summit, makes Mount Hood a microcosm of the Pacific Northwest's natural beauty.

### South Side Route (Hogsback / Pearly Gates)
The South Side Route is the most popular and shortest route to the summit, starting from the Timberline Lodge. The climb begins on a dedicated climbers' trail along the east side of the ski area, passing landmarks such as the Silcox Hut at 7,000 feet. The route continues to the top of the Palmer ski lift at 8,600 feet, a crucial waypoint where many climbers take a break and assess conditions.

From the top of the Palmer lift, the path leads towards Crater Rock, navigating between the Devil's Kitchen fumaroles, known for their sulfuric emissions, and Steel Cliff. The next key landmark is the Hogsback, a snow ridge leading to the Bergschrund, a large crevasse often requiring careful crossing. Climbers ascend through the Pearly Gates, a narrow and frequently icy chute between rock towers, before reaching the summit.

### Key Landmarks
- **Silcox Hut:** A historic structure serving as a waypoint.
- **Palmer Glacier:** A popular stopping point and the last major break before the final ascent.
- **Crater Rock:** A prominent feature marking the entry into the more technical portions of the climb.
- **Devil's Kitchen:** Notable for its fumaroles emitting gases that can create oxygen-depleted zones.
- **Hogsback:** A crucial ridge that serves as a path to the summit's upper reaches.
- **Bergschrund:** A significant crevasse that can pose challenges depending on snow conditions.
- **Pearly Gates:** The final steep ascent through a narrow chute to the summit.

An early start, often around midnight, is critical for a safe ascent. This "Alpine start" helps climbers avoid rockfall, which becomes more prevalent as temperatures rise throughout the day. It ensures that they descend before the afternoon when weather conditions deteriorate rapidly.

## Regulations
Starting January 1, 2024, a permit is required to climb above 9,500 feet. Permits can be purchased online at [Recreation.gov](https://www.recreation.gov). Additionally, climbers are encouraged to fill out a climbers' registration form, available at the Timberline Climbers' Cave. Please use "blue bags" for waste disposal. Mountain Locator Units (MLUs) are available for rental to assist in emergencies.

## Lodging & Camping
Camping options include:
- **Palmer Glacier:** Near exposed rocks above the lift, below Crater Rock.
- **Timberline Lodge Parking Lot:** Sleeping in vehicles is allowed.
- **National Forest Area:** Below the lodge, accessible via the first left after the Timberline access road from US-26.

Camping on the summit is permitted but uncommon. There are no fees or registration requirements for these camping options.
