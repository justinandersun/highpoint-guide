At an elevation of 1,235 feet above sea level, Charles Mound is the highest point in Illinois, ranking 45th in elevation among the U.S. states. Located in the northwest corner of the state, near the town of Galena, Charles Mound sits less than half a mile from the Wisconsin border. Unlike much of the Midwest, this region wasnâ€™t flattened by glacial activity and features rolling hills, limestone bluffs, and picturesque scenery.

The Sears Tower in Chicago stands 1,450 feet tall with a ground elevation of 583 feet, putting its top at 2,033 feet above sea level. But since the tower is human-made, Charles Mound remains the state's official highpoint.

Locating Charles Mound can be challenging as no signs on the road indicate the highpoint. The nearest landmark is the town of Scales Mound. From there, head northeast and take Charles Mound Road for about a mile. After a sharp left and then a sharp right turn, look for the first driveway on the left, marked by a small blue sign with the street number 688 (the sign may be missing). The driveway, which leads to Charles Mound, has a metal gate. Visitors must park in front of the gate and walk up the gravel driveway for one mile to a farmhouse. Continue past the farmhouse on the dirt driveway; the highpoint is about a quarter mile further on the right.
