Mount Arvon may not be the most imposing peak, but it's Michigan's highest point. Located in the Huron Mountain Range in the north-central Upper Peninsula (U.P.), the mountain rises over 1,300 feet from the shores of Lake Superior, approximately 10 miles to the north. Despite its modest elevation, Mount Arvon offers a scenic and enjoyable hiking experience.

Mount Arvon was only recognized as Michigan's highest point in 1982 when a USGS survey determined its elevation to be 1,979.238 feet, just 11 inches higher than the previously identified high point, Mount Curwood, at 1,978 feet. This minor difference has led to some disputes, and some maps still incorrectly label Curwood as the highest. Historically, reaching Mount Arvon was challenging due to its remote location and maze of logging roads, but recent improvements have made the journey more accessible. The area around Mount Arvon is rich in natural beauty and reflects the rugged, unspoiled character of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
