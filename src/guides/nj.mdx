New Jersey might be more famous for its freeways, Bruce Springsteen, beaches, and even some notorious toxic waste sites, but it also boasts a picturesque and proud high point. High Point, located in the extreme northern corner of the state, is not a standalone mountain but rather the highest elevation along the Kittatinny Mountain ridge. The state has erected an impressive monument in the style of a classical obelisk at this location, making it a focal point of High Point State Park. The colossal monument offers stunning 360-degree views of New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

High Point State Park was created in 1923 through the generous donation of land by Anthony and Susie Dryden Kuser. The High Point Monument, constructed between 1928 and 1930, honors New Jersey veterans and is modeled after the Washington Monument. The park spans over 16,000 acres, offering a rich blend of natural beauty and historical significance.
