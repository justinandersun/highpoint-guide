Taum Sauk Mountain is the highest point in the St. Francis Mountains, Iron County, and Missouri. While it is not the most prominent point in the state—that honor goes to the shorter Mudlick Mountain to the south—Taum Sauk Mountain offers a unique and accessible hiking experience. Located in Taum Sauk Mountain State Park, the mountain is a walk-up summit that is ADA-accessible. It ranks as the 41st highest state highpoint in the United States and is home to Missouri's tallest waterfall, Mina Sauk Falls, which drops 132 feet in three distinct stages. The park is particularly stunning in the spring when the waterfall is at its peak flow and in the fall when the foliage displays brilliant colors of yellow, red, and green.

Taum Sauk Mountain and the surrounding area have a rich history tied to the ancient St. Francis Mountains, a range believed to be one of the oldest exposed landforms in North America. The region is steeped in natural beauty and cultural significance, with a diverse ecosystem and a history of native peoples who once inhabited the area. The park is a testament to the conservation efforts to preserve Missouri's natural heritage and provide recreational opportunities for visitors.
